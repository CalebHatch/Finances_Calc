# Overview

This software will take in all of your monthly expenses (plus a custom amount to savings) and give you a financial evalulation based on that.

I didn't know Rust at all before writing this software, so this software was primarily made to help me learn the basics of rust.

This software was made in Rust and used crates from the Rust Standard Library.
